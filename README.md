# SwiftSafari

SwiftSafari is a project that aims to provide an introduction to data science concepts and the Swift programming language through building various tools from scratch. These tools include neural networks, genetic algorithms, and more.

The project is designed to be a follow-along project, meaning that you can work through the code examples and exercises alongside the accompanying blog posts and videos to get a deeper understanding of the concepts being covered.

Getting Started

To get started with SwiftSafari, you can either follow along with oen of the project tutorials at oceanexplains.medium.com, or you can clone the project. You'll need to have either Xcode or Swift Playgrounds installed on your machine. Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) for building apps for macOS, iOS, and other Apple platforms. You can download Xcode and Swift Playgrounds for free from the Mac App Store.
